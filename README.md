# Glottal-Instants-Extraction-from-Speech-using-GAN
Identification of the Glottal Closure and Opening Instants is done from speech signals.

This was a project done from Jan-May 2021 as a mini project in the course 'Speech and Audio Processing'.

Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) and Glottal Opening Instants (GOIs) represent
the instants in time when the vocal folds close and open respectively while producing
voiced signals. The Electroglottographic like (EGG-like) signal is synthesized from speech signal using Generative Adversarial Networks
(GAN). To identify the Glottal Closure and Opening Instants, we first compute the
derivative of the EGG-like signal, which is essentially a difference EGG-like signal.
The database (CMU Arctic) consists of simultaneous recordings of speech and EGG
signal, respectively. To evaluate the results, the locations obtained from synthesized
EGG-like signal are compared with the reference difference EGG signal.
